**Summary (150 words)**

I used Selenium IDE to automate testing of a simple login page.

The test case included both valid and invalid credentials. 
Selenium recorded user actions and assertions, allowing me to verify success and error messages without writing code. 
After running the test multiple times, I observed consistent results: 
valid credentials triggered a success message, while invalid ones showed an error. 
Compared to manual testing, AI-enhanced automation improves coverage by suggesting edge cases like empty fields or incorrect formats. 
It also speeds up regression testing and reduces human error. 
The visual dashboard in Selenium IDE helped me track test outcomes and debug failures quickly. 
Overall, AI-powered testing tools like Selenium IDE make web testing more efficient, reliable, and scalable â€” especially for critical flows like login.
